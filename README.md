[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/secml-malware/badge/?version=latest)](https://secml-malware.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Python library for creating adversarial attacks against Windows Malware detectors.
Built on top of [SecML](https://secml.gitlab.io), SecML Malware includes most of the attack proposed in the state of the art.
We include a [pre-trained MalConv](https://github.com/endgameinc/ember) model trained by EndGame, used for testing.

# Included Attacks

* **Partial DOS Header manipulation**, formulated by [Demetrio et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03583)
* **Padding attack**, formulated by [Kolosnjaji et al.](http://pralab.diee.unica.it/sites/default/files/kolosnjaji18-eusipco.pdf)
* **GAMMA**, formulated by [Demetrio et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13526)
* **FGSM padding + slack** formulated by [Kreuk et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04528) and [Suciu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08280)
* **Content shifting and DOS header extension** formulated by [Demetrio et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.07125.pdf)
* **Header Fields** inspired by [Nisi et al.](https://www.s3.eurecom.fr/~darion/papers/raid2021.pdf)


# Installation

Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the project.
I recommend creating a new environment (I use `conda`):
```bash
conda create -n secml_malware_env python=3.9
conda activate secml_malware_env
pip install git+https://github.com/zangobot/ember.git
pip install secml-malware
```

[//]: # (You also need to install `pytorch`, [find instructions here]&#40;https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/&#41;. )

[//]: # (Also, you might neet to install *libmagic as well*. [Follow these instructions]&#40;https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic#installation&#41; to install properly libmagic.)

If you are an Apple Silicon user, please install *lightgbm* from conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge lightgbm
```

# How to use
Activate your environment, and import the `secml_malware` package inside your script:
```python
import secml_malware
print(secml_malware.__version__)
```
The tests included in this project show how the library can be used for applying the manipulation to the input programs.
There is also an [example Jupyter notebook tutorial](https://github.com/zangobot/secml_malware/blob/master/attack_tutorial.ipynb) that shows how to build a apply a standard attack.

# Docker
There is also a `Dockerfile` that can be used to start a container and test the library without messing with virtual environments!
```bash
docker build --tag secml_malware:0.2.9.1 .
docker run --rm -it secml_malware:0.2.9.1 bash
```
The container is also shipped with `ipython`, for a more interactive experience with this library.

# Bug reports
If you encounter something strange, feel free to open an issue! I am working a lot, and bugs are present everywhere.
Let me know, and I'll try to fix them as soon as possible.

# Testing
I provide a small test suite for the attacks I have developed inside the plugin.
If you want to run them, **ADD GOODWARE/MALWARE samples!**
There are two distinct folders: 
```
secml_malware/data/goodware_samples
secml_malware/data/malware_samples/test_folder
```
Please, add samples to both folders (**if and only if** you want to run the internal tests).
